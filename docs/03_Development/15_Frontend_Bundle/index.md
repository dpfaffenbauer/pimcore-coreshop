# Frontend Bundle

The CoreShop Store Front, also known as the FrontendBundle, provides a default implementation that serves as a practical
guide for working with the CoreShop Framework. It is designed to showcase how various functionalities can be implemented
in a store environment.

## Components of the Frontend Bundle

The FrontendBundle includes various components, each focusing on a specific aspect of the store front:

- **Controllers**: The bundle includes a set of controllers that manage the interactions between the store front's user
  interface and the underlying CoreShop functionalities. These controllers can be customized to fit the specific needs
  of your store.

The CoreShop Frontend is a fully functional store front that can be used as a reference for building your own store. It
is meant as a Demo and not as a production-ready store.
